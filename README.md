<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To set up a local copy of the current patch of Reverdle, simply go to metabole.ga/reverdle, press CTRL+S, select "Webpage, Complete", and then go into the directory you saved it to and open the index.html page. This version will eventually fall forward/backward in terms of used words as it is not going to sync with this version.
